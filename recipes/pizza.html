    <h1>Easy Tortilla Pizza</h1>

    <img src="../images/Pizza.jpg" alt="A picture of a tortilla pizza" height="320">

    <p>This tortilla pizza is extremely easy to make. It is light enough to be a snack, serves well as </p> 
    <p>an appetizer, or is so good that it can be devoured alone! You can use any sort of topping</p> 
    <p>variation. The one below is the classic way I usually prepare it but feel free to experiment.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
