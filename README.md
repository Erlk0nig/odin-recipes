# Odin Recipes

This is a simple HTML project created as part of the [Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The goal of the project is to build a basic recipe website using only HTML to practice working with links, images, and file structure.

## üîç Project Description

The website consists of:

- A **main homepage** (`index.html`) that contains links to individual recipes.
- **Individual recipe pages**, each containing:
  - A title
  - A description of the dish
  - An image
  - A list of ingredients
  - A list of preparation steps

This project focuses purely on HTML and helps solidify the following concepts:
- Proper HTML structure
- Working with relative paths
- Linking between pages using anchor (`<a>`) tags
- Using images with the `<img>` tag
- Organizing content with lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`) and headings
